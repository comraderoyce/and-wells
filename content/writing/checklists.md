Checklists are heavily used in critical industries where small mistakes will lead to loss of life. For example, checklists are used heavily in aviation, astronomical engineering, and nuclear power plants.

Checklist use and format can supply lessosns for other industries that can benefit from eliminating errors in procedural tasks.  

Here are some example checklists.
