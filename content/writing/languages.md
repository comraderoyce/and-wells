Some basic notes on learning languages.

# Learn the rules 

Rules are useful and help you pick up a language more quickly. Languages typically have rather strict rules for grammar and word construction. English is an interesting exception. It has lots of rules and lots of exceptions to said rules. Other languages are more strict. For example, the pronunciation rules of French make it quite easy to spell any word. The Sorbonne program was extremely diligent about this to the point of having a daily pronunciation course as part of our main French language track. This is also why spelling bees are a distinctly English-language phenomenon. There are plenty of other examples. [Arabic](https://www.learnarabiconline.com/arabic-morphology-introduction/) has a very strict set of grammar rules. It is useful to pick these up as shortcuts. Just be warned that knowing how to spell and write doesn't help your accent.

# Learn filler

Basic phrases are useful, but regular conversation is mostly filler. 

It is a quick study to pick up the 100 most used words and phrases in a language. Seldom on these lists is the way we use many casual words when talking. Anecdotally, Parisian French got a lot easier to understand once I realized every third word was some long filler like _franchement_. 

# Learn locally

Slang and other colloquialisms are regional and not included in textbooks. The corollary to this is that you can't substitute book learning for full conversation if you want to be a fluent speaker. Plus it is much easier to learn when you have to speak exclusively in the language Lots of people speak English so easy to default back to, but you should resist this temptation. It's taken me much longer to pick up basic Ewe because I default to French for conversations. Learn early the phrase to ask people to repeat themselves and use it often.

# Learn in the countryside

Hit the countryside for faster gains. French got easier when I got to travel to the Basque region. The general speed of conversation and accent was much easier to follow than the speed of Parisian French. West African French is easier for me to use day today. Learning in Paris was actually harder because of the speed and clip of conversation (think New York vs Houston English)

# Learn young

A bit tongue in cheek but my oldest has enough grasp of three languages to be able to hold regular conversations in all of them. Meanwhile, I'm struggling to pick up my third. The second best time to start is now.
