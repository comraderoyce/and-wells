Proposal for targeting advertisements at personality profiles. 

<!--more--> 

Pesonality profiles allow for the direct target of messages and imagery to segments of one person. 

Higher conversion rates follow. Current deomographic and term targeting can be enhanced by filtering the data through additional factors based on psychomterics.

We can determine personality profiles from any number of factors. Our likes, dislikes, status updates, the people we follow and the people we retweet correspond to specific personality indicators. 

The typical ones are the Big 5: extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism.

Already you can tie personal data to personality profiles with high accuracy. 

Once you know a personality profile, you can tailor messages to be more resonant. 

Language and tone matched to personality profiling has proven effect on behavior change. 

Current targeting methods have only taken in to account changes in location (where the ads are served). Content has still been largely ignored. 

Academic and business explorations around personality targeting focus on finding the personality traits that will most likely resonate with a single message. The opportunity is to craft the message to fit the target. 

The posibilities are endless, but initial research has shown that this method is effective. 

From there you can see the applications of a machine learning platform to creating resonate messaging in advertising. Not a small leap, but enough that there are few people thinking about this.
