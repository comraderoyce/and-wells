Notes on creating digital products. Updated regulary.

## Features

Minimum unit for a product is a feature that delivers value. Some products have single features while others are feature-rich. 

## Value

Value is derived by a user taking advantage of a feature to complete a task. These tasks can be simple or complex. Mature products allow a diverse set of tasks within the product framework, allowing ther user to derive value from the product. For example, ATMs are a feature that allows a retail banking customer to access petty cash. 

## Users and Value

Until the user accesses is a feature of your product, no value is created. A sign saying "ATM coming soon" is not helpful to someone that needs cash.
