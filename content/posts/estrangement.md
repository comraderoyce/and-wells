Evaluating user engagement on Twitter.

<!--more--> 


There is something strange going on in the internet lands, specifically in the social media fiefdom of Twitter. While it has fundamentally changed the way real time content is served and consumed, much of the content we create has failed to adapt. This is evident when one looks at the statistics for Twitter engagement. Across the board organizations and individuals fail to attract favorites, retweets, and replies. Yet Twitter users are not disengaged. They create tons of content each day. They hold conversations and ask questions, and retweet, favorite and reply. There is a disconnect between what people are actually engaging with on Twitter and most of Twitter’s content.

[Data from the first of this year](http://www.statisticbrain.com/twitter-statistics/) say there are 645,750,000 registered users who tweet 58 million times a day. Another 135,000 accounts are created every day. Looking around, we see that users are creating content. What we see relatively less of, is users engaging in others content. At least, not with the content we would expect. Engagement on Twitter comes in three measurable forms. A retweet publishes another’s tweet to your own followers. A favorite saves another’s tweet in a public section of your profile. A reply lets you send your own tweet mentioning the original author.

So we go look in the most obvious place we would find lots of engagement: the users with the most followers. Currently the top three most followed users on Twitter are

1. Katy Perry: 51,710,288 followers

1. Justin Bieber: 50,485,183 followers

1. Barack Obama: 42,206,322 followers

On the surface those are some pretty impressive numbers. Yet looking closer, we see that these numbers are not all they appear to be. Here is a sample from Twitter’s most followed user.

So on a tweet from a user with over 50 million followers, on a subject that we might expect her followers to show interest in, we have engagement numbers that are rather dismal. Sure 14,000 retweets and favorites apiece is not bad at all. Especially when the average Twitter user has under 300 followers. But it is not what we would expect from the number of followers that Katy Perry has. **She is getting just under 3 retweets per 10,000 followers.**

Let’s continue looking. Barack Obama’s tweet after winning the 2012 presidential election became the most retweeted tweet on Twitter:

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/aa9eac63dbcc40131399bb99c5834e37" frameborder=0></iframe>

This was the most retweeted tweet of 2012. It was the most retweeted tweet of all time until Ellen’s oscar stunt. This gem had hundreds of thousands of retweets in hours. But even this tweet was only retweeted by 186 out of every 10,000 of Obama’s followers. That’s less than 2 people for every 100 that follows Obama.

That means that if you have only 100 followers, you can get better engagement than one of the most retweeted tweets ever by getting just 3 people to retweet you. It seems strange that even with the most prolific of tweets, the engagement is still not present. 779,000 people is certainly a lot, but this number is diminished as a percentage of Obama’s 40 million followers.

What about the most retweeted tweet ever: the famed Ellen selfie, the tweet that crashed Twitter and broke the internet?

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/93556bd34c68e5c9695de13ff8f1c885" frameborder=0></iframe>

The most retweeted tweet ever, still just 1,214 out of every 10,000 of Ellen’s followers, only 1 retweet for every 10 of her followers. This is also three weeks and a ton of media exposure after the original tweet. The tweet broke Twitter’s retweet functionality without even a quarter of Ellen’s followers.

Companies don’t do much better. [Simply Measured](http://get.simplymeasured.com/twitter-study-pm.html) estimates that brands that have less than 100,000 followers generate an average of 16 interactions per tweet. Brands with 750,000-999,000 followers average 289 interactions per tweet, around 2 and 3 interactions per 10,000 followers respectively. Brands with over 1 million followers average less with only 232 engagements per tweet, 2.32 engagements per 10,000 followers. So those numbers aren’t that great either.

Most Twitter users have nowhere near 10,000 followers. Yet they are still discouraged when their tweets are not shared around and favorited by the people that see them. The dirty secret of Twitter is that hardly anyone gets good engagement. Your most retweeted tweet probably has better engagement percentages than even the most followed Twitter users. An interesting side effect of the state of Twitter engagement is that you can add substantially to your engagement numbers by simply cultivating an active audience.

[@HistoryInPics](https://twitter.com/HistoryInPics), one of the larger Twitter accounts that tweets old photos, has better Twitter engagement than most. The account is run by two teenagers and started in July 2013. They tweet old photos, often just public domain images, and regularly get more than 1,000 retweets. With only 1.25 million followers they got 8 retweets for every 10,000 of their followers.

Those are much better numbers than most brands. Their more popular tweets get amazing engagement numbers for Twitter. This tweet about the Breakfast Club has 1 retweet for every 100 followers. That’s half as good as Obama’s post-election photo. Oh what CMOs would do for those kind of Twitter numbers, or pretty much anyone on Twitter for that matter.

Retweets are one of the few ways to get your Twitter content out to other users that don’t yet follow you. So one of the best ways to grow your following is having good engagement. Especially engagement that is disproportionate to your number of followers. This is part of the reason small, focused accounts like @HistoryInPics are able to grow so fast. Tweets that speak directly to their audience get outsized engagement numbers, which in turn grows their audience even larger.

@HistoryInPics is one of many new Twitter accounts that caters to a niche audience and focuses on content intended for user engagement. They get free celebrity endorsements and news stories. Marketing departments everywhere are scrambling to build their social media divisions. They intuitively understand the power in accounts like @HistoryInPics, but don’t yet fully understand how to reenact such success with their own company accounts.

It’s funny to think that company executives could be jealous of the marketing savvy of a pair of teens, but that’s an example of how Twitter has changed the game. On one hand, retweets and favorites cannot be the best measure of our content when even the best tweets by this measure only engage small portions of our followers. On the other hand, engagement is clearly crucial to building an audience on social media. Retweets and favorites are social proof. They confirm the value of your content and spread it to a larger audience. @HistoryInPics could easily develop any number of business models on their homegrown audience. They could build a business entirely on Twitter, their engaged audience serving as a solid foundation.

You can add immense value to any Twitter account by engaging in their content on Twitter and—even more importantly—getting others to engage their content. Just your retweet will boost the numbers of the vast majority of Twitter accounts. The average user has only 208 followers, and even one retweet blows their engagement numbers away. Even the more followed accounts don’t see huge Twitter engagement. A resourceful individual can think of a bunch of opportunities because of that.
