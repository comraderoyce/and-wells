Hey, I'm Royce Wells. 

I work at the intersection of technology and business. 

Currently I am an Account Manager at [Comrade](http://comradeagency.com), a digital strategy and design agency, leading projects in our social and environmental programs and web practice. I also run [KnowTheZodiac](https://knowthezodiac.com) with my wife [Doss√©-Via](http://dossevia.com).

## Brief History

I started messing around with computers when I was 4 (1996) and built my first website in 4th grade (2001) using Microsoft Frontpage. In high school (2006-2008), I ran a niche [blog](http://wellsoneducation.wordpress.com) on secondary education before getting accepted at [The University of Southern California](https://usc.edu) (2009). At USC I studied history, spent a year abroad in France, and built more websites for students and school organizations. 

After graduation (2013), I started a consulting group to create websites and digital campaigns for small businesses in Los Angeles, including work with a number of [local](http://wisereaderstoleaders.org/) nonprofit organizations. I also worked with my wife (then girlfriend) to build out the first digital products for her growing online astrology business [ScorpioMystique](https://scorpiomystique.com). 

I moved to Oakland and joined [Comrade](http://comradeagency.com) (2014) as an Account Executive, working on website design and development. Since, I've worked on projects for clients like [BlackRock](https://blackrock.com), [Coca-Cola](https://us.coca-cola.com/), and [Wells Fargo](https://www.wellsfargo.com/). I started working with Comrade's newest nonprofit clients (2015) and helped build the social and environmental programs over the next few years. The team has built websites and other digital products for nonprofits like [FairTrade Certified](https://fairtradecertified.org) and [Humanity United](https://humanityunited.org). Comrade was acquired by [CI&T](https://us.ciandt.com) (2017) and I moved to New York.

## Currently

I work at Comrade leading various projects on our web practice with a focus on financial services and mission-based organizations.  I also head the product team for [KnowTheZodiac](http://knowthezodiac.com). I live in Harlem with my wife and daugther.

I love to travel with my family and still mess around with computers. I keep notes on the things I'm working on and thinking about [here](/writing/) on the site. If you want to get in touch with me, [reach out](/contact/).
